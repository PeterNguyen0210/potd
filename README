================

This project is part of a BA thesis. It is all but not finished yet.
(Currently) Supported protocols:
  ssh with libssh

Suits perfect for your favoured Desktop/Server/OpenWrt Linux system.


TODOs
=====

Priority == Item order!
1. RESTful listener for output sampled data from different processes
    (send (real-time)statistics about protocols/jails/etc to highler level apps)
2. ptrace support for jailed apps (trace syscalls)
3. implement more protocols such as HTTP/SCADA/MySQL/telnet/...
4. improved event handling (maybe libevent?)
